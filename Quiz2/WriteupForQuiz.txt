Problems one and three were kind of isomorphic. Both were arithmetic operations on floats which were taken as an integer input and converted. The ToFloat subroutine was the largest hurdle to hop in tihs assignemnt. The mapping of ints to floats is linear so the sign can be ignored once saved. and I knew counting the digits instead of binary places would give me more useful information, which I used to detect both wheter the number should be zero, exponent, and shift amount for the mantissa. By writing to float as a function I could write both one and three top down, before writing ToFloat. This reduced the mental load on me.
